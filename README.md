## ‚ùìAbout

This project helps people in the United States find actions they can take to help the people in Palestine. It takes into account that everyone is different and let's you filter in actions based on what resources you have available to you. 

I feel admittedly hopeless to actually stop the Israeli genocide of the Palestinian people, but I don't want to accept that defeat. I don't have much to give but my skills and time, and so this is what I am giving. 

This project focuses on people in the United States, because that's what I know about and am the only contributer currently. 

## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing

Interested in contributing? Sweet! Check out the issues and submit a pull request. I could especially use help setting up a privacy-friendly backend, preferably not using products that help Israel financially. 

# üåü Spread the word!

There are a lot of people who ask what they can do. This literally walks them through what they can do based on what resources/positions/skills they have. 

# ‚ö†Ô∏è License

You can use this for anything you want except for helping countries like Israel and Azerbaijan commit genocide.
